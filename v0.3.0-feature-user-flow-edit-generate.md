v0.3.0-feature-user-flow-edit-generate.md

Here’s a concrete tweak that keeps your sales-safe preview but gives users just enough pre-purchase control to feel ownership (and convert).

Recommended flow: “Generate → Edit-lite → Checkout”

Minimal dev lift, big UX gain. You’re not changing the core engine—just where/when people can tweak.

0) Entry (unchanged)

Landing / → enter role → /kit?role=Program Manager
Auto-generate on load with Express Mode.

1) Edit-lite before pay (what’s new)

Two-pane builder stays. The left pane becomes a focused “Edit-lite” panel with inline AI assists for a handful of high-leverage fields:

Editable pre-purchase fields (only):

Role → Title, Mission (1–2 lines)

Scorecard → Outcomes (up to 3 bullets), Responsibilities (up to 5 bullets)

Job Post → Must/Should have (up to 5 each)

Interview Pack → Add/remove up to 3 questions per stage (from suggestions)

Work Sample → Scenario one-liner

Smart helpers (chips):

“Add example responsibilities” (click to insert curated chips)

“Rewrite for clarity” / “Make more concise” (AI quick actions)

“Match nonprofit tone” (tone toggle)

Preview rules stay sales-safe:

Right pane updates live, still first-page only, truncated bullets, watermark, 3=Meets row only, copy disabled.

Why it works: users can personalize the inputs (and a tiny slice of outputs) without ever seeing or copying the full content.

2) Micro-regen by section

Next to each editable group, add a “Regenerate section” button.

Affects only the dependent artifact(s) (e.g., Outcomes → Scorecard + Job Post).

Limit to 3 regens/section pre-purchase to deter scraping; show a tiny counter “2/3”.

3) Template & industry presets (lightweight)

Above the editor: three dropdowns that only influence phrasing/examples (no layout change).

Industry: General, Nonprofit, Education, Faith-based, SMB

Seniority: Coordinator, Manager, Director

Style: Formal, Plain-English, Friendly

Apply as prompt tags to all subsequent regenerations.

4) Checkout moment (clear promise)

Right rail keeps:

“What you’ll get” checklist (all 9 docs + exports)

“Unlock full kit — $99 DIY / $249 Interviewed” (or your current pricing)

Bullet under CTA: “Full content, all edits enabled, combined PDF + ZIP + text bundle”

5) Post-purchase (unlock real editing)

After payment:

All sections editable (no truncation), unlimited regens

Export: combined PDF, ZIP (per artifact), Markdown bundle

Save versions (v1, v2…) and download history

UI sketch (behavioral)

Left editor uses compact cards with “+ suggestion chips” and a tiny “Refine with AI” button.

Right preview shows a lock badge where content is truncated. Hover tooltip: “Unlock to see the full kit.”

On copy attempt → tiny toast: “Previews are truncated. Unlock to export.”

Exactly what to build (MVP delta)
A) UI

Add edit controls for: Title, Mission, Outcomes, Responsibilities, Must/Nice, Questions (3 per stage), Scenario.

Add chips drawer under Outcomes/Responsibilities for insertable suggestions.

Add tone/industry/seniority dropdowns that set prompt tags.

B) API

New endpoints (skinny):

PATCH /api/kits/:id/inputs → update intake fields

POST /api/kits/:id/sections/:section/regenerate

section ∈ {scorecard, job_post, interview_stage1, interview_stage2, interview_stage3, work_sample}

(keep) POST /api/kits/:id/generate for first pass

Server enforces pre-purchase limits (fields, regen counts).

C) Gating logic (unchanged core)

Preview renderer always rasterizes page-1 and truncates bullets to ~10–12 words.

Rubrics show only the 3 = Meets row.

Copy/contextmenu blocked in preview DOM.

D) Data

Keep edits as edited_json merged over artifacts_json.

Track regen_counts per section.

E) Analytics (to learn fast)

edit_field, regen_section, switch_mode (Express/Detailed), open_templates, checkout_start, purchase.

Funnel watch:

Express → Edit-lite used?

Any regen before checkout?

Which fields predict purchase?

Why this beats “preview-only”

Users feel ownership (they nudge inputs and see improvement).

You reduce refunds (more fit before payment).

Engineering stays tight: a PATCH + per-section regen endpoint and a small set of editable fields.

Optional niceties (day-2)

Diff view: small “AI vs yours” toggle per section.

Confidence meter: “Kit quality: Good / Great” (simple heuristic: are outcomes filled? responsibilities ≥5?).

Magic link: “Save and send link to myself” pre-purchase (email + magic token).

Acceptance criteria (simple)

A new user can type a title, see a kit, edit mission/outcomes/responsibilities, regen the Scorecard, and hit Unlock—all within 90 seconds.

Preview stays first page only + truncated + watermarked; copy is blocked.

No more than 3 pre-purchase regens per section; limits reset post-purchase.

Post-purchase, all edits + exports are enabled.
