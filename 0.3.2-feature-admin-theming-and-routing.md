# Feature Request: Admin UI Accessibility/Theming + Correct “View” Routing + Order Detail

**Date:** 2025-08-16
**Owner:** Product (Hiring Kit)
**Status:** Proposed — High Priority (usability + trust)

## 1) Background / Problem
- The current **Admin theme** (white bg + black elements + dark text) produces **low contrast** and **hard‑to‑read tables/buttons**.
- The **Order “View”** button links to an obsolete **`/kit/:id`** path (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/kit/<uuid>`), which is **not functional** for admins and does **not match** the user order/checkout/success flows.
- Admins lack a single **Order Detail** screen to inspect intake, artifacts, and downloads — forcing context switching and slowing support.

## 2) Goals (What success looks like)
1. Admin screens are **clean, readable, and accessible** (WCAG AA) across light surfaces.
2. All admin links use **consistent, protected routes** under `/admin/*` (no localhost, no user pages).
3. Admins can open an **Order Detail** and immediately see customer, org, kit, payment status, and **download** the artifacts.
4. Pro/HITL orders expose a clear **review → edit → version → approve** path directly from Order Detail.

## 3) Scope (Functional Requirements only)

### FR‑A: Admin Theming & Accessibility Overhaul
- **Default theme:** Light on light, with clear separation between backgrounds, cards, tables, and action elements.
- **Readability:** Typography sizes/weights that are legible at a glance; adequate spacing in tables and forms.
- **Contrast:** All text and key UI states meet **WCAG AA** contrast on the chosen backgrounds.
- **States:** Hover/focus/active/disabled styles are visible and consistent; focus rings are obvious for keyboard users.
- **Tables:** Zebra or row hover, sticky header on long lists, readable badges for statuses (QA pending, Ready, Paid, Awaiting Payment).
- **Feedback:** Inline errors and success toasts are legible and non‑ambiguous.
- **Mobile/responsive:** Admin tables and detail views remain usable on small screens.

**Acceptance Criteria (FR‑A)**
- No elements render **dark text on dark surfaces** or **light text on light surfaces**.
- Admin list and detail pages pass a visual **contrast check** (AA) and **keyboard navigation** (tab to all interactive items).
- Provide screenshots (desktop 1440px and mobile 390px) of **/admin**, **/admin/orders**, **/admin/orders/:id**.

### FR‑B: Correct “View” Routing for Orders (Consistent Admin URLs)
- Replace legacy links to `http://localhost:3000/kit/<uuid>` (or `/kit/:id`) with **`/admin/orders/:orderId`**.
- Ensure all order links in Admin (cards, table rows, buttons) open the **Admin Order Detail** view — not a user page.
- Links must be **environment‑relative** (no hardcoded hostnames) and work on dev, preview, and prod.
- If an order lacks a kit reference, the button is disabled with a tooltip or routes to a helpful empty state.

**Acceptance Criteria (FR‑B)**
- Clicking **View** on any order in `/admin` opens **`/admin/orders/:orderId`**.
- There are **no** links to `localhost` or `/kit/:id` from admin screens.
- Deep‑linking to `/admin/orders/:orderId` works when pasted into a new tab and is **auth‑protected**.

---

### FR‑C: Admin Order Detail (Inspect, Download, Support)
- A dedicated **Order Detail** page under `/admin/orders/:orderId` showing:
  - **Header:** Order ID, Plan (DIY/Pro), Status, Amount, Created date/time.
  - **Customer:** Email (+ optional name), link to customer profile.
  - **Organization:** Name, link to org page.
  - **Kit Summary:** Role title; quick link to **/admin/kits/:kitId** (if needed).
  - **Downloads:** Combined PDF, ZIP of artifacts, latest version tag (v1/v2…).
  - **Intake & Artifacts:** Read‑only preview of intake values and generated sections (page‑1 previews are fine for admin read‑only).
  - **Actions:** Resend email, Mark Paid / Comp (if awaiting_payment), Approve & Publish (for Pro), Add internal note.
  - **Timeline/Audit:** Key events (generation, payments, emails, approvals).
- Empty/edge states are explained (e.g., “No exports yet”, “Kit not generated”).

**Acceptance Criteria (FR‑C)**
- Admins can locate any order and **download** the latest kit exports directly from the Order Detail page.
- Admins can **resend delivery email** and **see audit entries** update.
- Pro orders display the appropriate **review actions**; DIY orders hide them.

### FR‑D: Pro Review Entry from Order Detail (Surfacing existing workflow)
- For **Pro/HITL** orders, provide a clear **“Open Review”** action from Order Detail that leads to the editor where admins can:
  - Edit key sections, regenerate, export new versions (v1/v2…).
  - Finally **Approve & Publish** to notify the customer.
- Show **revision passes remaining** (if policy is 2 within 7 days).

**Acceptance Criteria (FR‑D)**
- Pro orders show a **QA status** (“qa_pending”, “in_review”, “ready”, “delivered”) prominently.
- Admins can complete the review cycle from Order Detail without navigating to non‑admin routes.
- Customer receives the standard **Ready** email on publish.

---

## 4) Out‑of‑Scope (for this request)
- Deep theming system or dark mode (can be a follow‑up).
- Customer self‑service portal (covered by separate feature request).
- New metrics dashboards (basic counts/filters remain).

## 5) Success Metrics
- **Admin task time** to find, open, and download an order’s kit **< 15 seconds**.
- **Zero** broken admin links to non‑admin pages in production.
- Support tickets referencing “can’t read admin page” → **0** after rollout.

## 6) Rollout Notes (non‑technical)
- Validate on **staging** with multiple orders (awaiting_payment, paid, qa_pending, ready).
- Capture **before/after** screenshots for accessibility review.
- Announce to the team: “Admin is now readable, routes are consistent, and Order Detail centralizes actions.”
